<h2>String conversion via perl</h2>
<p>
The following code converts and maps ASCII character strings into a hexadecimal ASCII code value array.
</p>
<p>
The "convert" subroutine is capable for the conversion.<br />
"convert" executes as the following to perform its task.<br />
1. The first argument is passed to a variable "$string".<br />
2. The string is then converted to a decimal value with "unpack".<br />
3. Unpacked values are mapped to an array with hexadecimal conversion with "sprintf".<br />
4. The array containing hexadecimal values is returned.
</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env perl

sub convert {
  my $string = shift;
  my @array = map{sprintf "%x", $_}unpack("C*", $string);
  return @array;
}
</pre>
